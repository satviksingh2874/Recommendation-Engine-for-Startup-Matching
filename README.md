# Recommendation-Engine-for-Startup-Matching

This project tackles the challenge of recommending optimal matches between startups, mentors, and service providers by analyzing their respective profile data. The dataset consists of multiple user types, where each entry characterizes a founder, mentor, or provider through attributes such as industry, project needs, technical requirements, core skills, and availability. The primary goal is to help users discover high-value connections by systematically computing how well their needs and offerings align.

To best address this many-to-many matchmaking problem, I used a fuzzification approach. Instead of strict or binary matching on categorical fields, I created dictionary mappings that score the similarity between each possible pair of values for relevant featuresâ€”allowing for partial and nuanced matching where it matters. For each potential match, the system performs dictionary lookups to obtain these similarity scores across all key attributes, then aggregates them using a weighted sum. This score is used to rank all possible matches, enabling the selection of top results even when exact attribute values don't perfectly align.

Looking forward, a major opportunity lies in collecting labeled feedback on which recommended matchings actually result in the most successful or fruitful outcomes for users. With enough such data, it would become possible to automatically learn or optimize both the scoring logic and the aggregation weights for each feature using machine learning. This would make the matching engine data-driven and continuously improving, rather than relying solely on expert intuition or hand-curated weights.
